# **Functioning prototype**

## **1. Interaction Instructions**

## **2. Details of my individual approach to animating the group code**

### I chose Perlin noise to drive my personal code.

###  SplitCircle Animation
- SplitCircle Animation
  - Class: SplitCircle

- Animated Properties:
  - Position drift (x, y)
Uses Perlin noise to create smooth floating motion in both axes, making each circle gently drift.
  - Dynamic angle rotation (angle)
The splitting line between colors rotates over time, driven by noise, creating an ever-changing color split.
