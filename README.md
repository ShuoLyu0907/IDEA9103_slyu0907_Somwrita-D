## **1. Interaction Instructions**

## **2. Details of my individual approach to animating the group code**

### I chose Perlin noise to drive my personal code.

###  Introduction to Image Animation：
- SplitCircle Animation
  - Class: SplitCircle
  - Animated Properties:
   - Position drift (x, y)
Uses Perlin noise to create smooth floating motion in both axes, making each circle gently drift.
   - Dynamic angle rotation (angle)
The splitting line between colors rotates over time, driven by noise, creating an ever-changing color split.
   - Radius pulsing (r)
A subtle breathing effect is achieved using a sine wave to make the circle expand and contract slightly.
  - Visual Effect:
A two-colored circle that gently drifts, breathes, and rotates its split angle—giving a lively and organic motion.
